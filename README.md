# About the project

This project is a collaborative team application developed as part of the final task for the Rolling Scopes School course by Reactive team. It represents an e-commerce platform designed to provide users with a smooth shopping experience, including features such as product browsing, search, filtering, detailed product views, a shopping cart, and a checkout process.

The purpose of this project is to apply and demonstrate the skills we have gained during the course, including teamwork, frontend development, API integration, and version control. This project simulates a real-world development environment where team members work together to build a functional, user-friendly web application.

### Project Purposes

✅ To demonstrate the ability to work effectively in a team on a shared codebase.
✅ To apply modern frontend development practices learned during the course.
✅ To build an interactive, responsive e-commerce web app that showcases a complete user journey, from browsing products to placing an order.
✅ To practice using GitHub, and pull requests in a collaborative workflow.
✅ To gain experience working with external APIs or mock data, ensuring smooth data handling and dynamic rendering.

# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type-aware lint rules:

```js
export default tseslint.config({
  extends: [
    // Remove ...tseslint.configs.recommended and replace with this
    ...tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked,
    // Alternatively, use this for stricter rules
    ...tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked,
    // Optionally, add this for stylistic rules
    ...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked,
  ],
  languageOptions: {
    // other options...
    parserOptions: {
      project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
});
```

You can also install [eslint-plugin-react-x](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-x) and [eslint-plugin-react-dom](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-dom) for React-specific lint rules:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import reactX from 'eslint-plugin-react-x';
import reactDom from 'eslint-plugin-react-dom';

export default tseslint.config({
  plugins: {
    // Add the react-x and react-dom plugins
    'react-x': reactX,
    'react-dom': reactDom,
  },
  rules: {
    // other rules...
    // Enable its recommended typescript rules
    ...reactX.configs['recommended-typescript'].rules,
    ...reactDom.configs.recommended.rules,
  },
});
```
